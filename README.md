# Team-profile-generator-WC12
Repo to hold code for WC12 - CLI to generate a team profile based on user input.

## Description

Using the starter code provided by Trilogy Education we were tasked with creating a CLI application to generate the HTML for a webpage that would display information on a team made up of a single Team Manager with an indermined amount of engineers and interns. Each class would have some arguments shared amoung them and some that were specific to that role.

The tests for the code were provided and part of the acceptance criteria stated that all tests passed.

This was a great exersise in practicing the use of npm modules and classes.

The result could be used by a team manager to visually display their Team Members and further development could mean the addiition of task/skills/experiance.
